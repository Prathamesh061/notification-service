This project is a full-stack notification system for remote teams, featuring real-time updates, role-based access, and email alerts for offline users and managers.

## Live Demo

- üåê [Deployed App on Render](https://notification-service-tn15.onrender.com/)
- üíª [Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Prathamesh061/notification-service)

## How to Use (Deployed App)

1. Visit [https://notification-service-tn15.onrender.com/](https://notification-service-tn15.onrender.com/)
2. Sign up as a **Manager** or **User** (choose your role during signup)
3. Log in with your credentials
4. **Managers** can create notifications (choose priority: normal or high)
5. All logged-in users (including managers) will see notifications in real time
6. If a notification is high priority and a user is offline, an email will be sent to them
7. Normal notifications auto-delete after 2 days; high-priority notifications persist
